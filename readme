# Simple modbus power simulator

# Setup
1. Have bundler
2. Run `bundle install`

# Architecture
```

#                  LOAD1
#                    O
#                    |
#                    |
#                  LINE2
#                    |
#                    |
#                    O----LINE3----O
# GEN1 O----LINE1----O             O----LINE5----O LOAD2
#                    O----LINE4----O
#                                  O
#                                  |
#                                  |
#                                LINE6
#                                  |
#                                  |
#                                  O
#                                LOAD3
```

Load 1 is 20, Load 2 is 40, and Load 3 is 50. The generator
can provide enough power. Line limits are
1. 120
2. 30
3. 60
4. 60
5. 75
6. 75

# Running
## Simulator
Run the simulator first (`bundle exec ruby simulator.rb`).
The simulator runs on a 1s tick rate. The only output from
the simulator is power in the lines (actual/max) and
loads serviced/generator utilization (actual/max).

While the simulator runs, power flow will update
on each tick, and any overloaded lines will gain
1 heat.

This all happens "inside" the simulator (excessive line temp, 
unserviced loads, or generator overload could
be reported out-of-band to penalize).

Each line runs as a different modbus server, which could be
bound to a different interface to give the appearance
of multiple servers/multiple devices. Currently, they all run
on localhost and bind to different ports (1500 + line).

## Monitor
The monitor runs as a HMI would over Modbus. It displays
temperature and state (open/closed).

## Protection
The protection runs separately, as if on some sort of
centralized monitoring/protection server. It doesn't have
any output, but will open (trip) a line if it goes
over the threshold.

Protection runs every 1 second.

## Trip and Close
Trip or close the numbered line.

## Set Threshold
Provide a line number and a new threshold.
